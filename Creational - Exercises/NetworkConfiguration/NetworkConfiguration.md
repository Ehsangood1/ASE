## Problem Description

You are developing a network management system for an IT company that sets up and manages computer networks for various clients. The company frequently deploys similar network configurations with slight variations based on client requirements such as security levels, bandwidth needs, and network topology.

Currently, network engineers manually configure each network setup from scratch, which is time-consuming and prone to configuration errors.

## Requirements

The company handles three main types of network deployments:

- **Corporate Networks**: Office networks with departments, security zones, and centralized management
- **Data Center Networks**: High-performance networks for server farms with redundancy and load balancing
- **Branch Office Networks**: Smaller networks that connect to corporate headquarters with VPN capabilities

### Network Structure

Each network configuration should contain:

- **Basic Information**: Network ID, client name, deployment type, creation date
- **Network Topology**: IP address ranges, subnet configurations, VLAN settings
- **Security Configuration**: Firewall rules, access controls, encryption settings
- **Device Settings**: Router configurations, switch settings, wireless access point configs
- **Performance Settings**: Bandwidth allocations, QoS rules, traffic shaping
- **Monitoring Setup**: Alert thresholds, logging configurations, health checks
